A Firefox add-on that looks up a highlighted Thai, Khmer, Burmese or Lao word at SEAlang.net and returns the result in a side or bottom panel.

The search command is located on the context menu, and corpus searches and bitext corpus searches at SEAlang are also available.

A "reverse-search" command is available -- it returns all definitions that use the English word highlighted -- for words that are not clearly identifiable as from a Southeast Asian language.

Right-clicking on the command in the context menu opens the panel on the bottom of the screen; toggling between left and bottom can be done by a button on the panel toolbar.

Other languages are planned, including Vietnamese.
